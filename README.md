# Shipbuilding Labor Competition

This github repo contains the scripts used to develop the CSIS Shipbuilding Competition tool. The data was pre-processed by researchers at CSIS - Futures Lab before being put on display here.

Data Sources:

-   United States Census Bureau
-   United States Bureau Labor Statistics (BLS)
-   Open source mapping for shipyard locations

The location data is offsetted at times due to how builders labeled their offices, sometimes they are on streets out of privacy concerns. The shipyard data and the concept for this project was born out of collection with the CSIS Center for Industrial Base's [Henry H. Carroll](https://www.csis.org/people/henry-h-carroll) and Futures Lab's [Jose M. Macias.](https://www.csis.org/people/jose-m-macias-iii)
